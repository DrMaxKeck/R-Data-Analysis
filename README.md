# R-Data-Analysis
My R Projects for Data Analysis that can't be done or that I don't want to do with SPSS

I am a Sociologist working at the Institute of Work and Qualification at the University Duisburg-Essen in Germany.
Maybe when you read this I work at another Institution and forgot to update this. Maybe not. You never know.

Here I would like to store my successful attempts with R Software and certain Packages that I use to Analyse different Data. Mostly survey-data and administrative data. 

What I can contribute with this for the Community: I am not sure. It is primarily a possibility for me to store my code :) 
I hope I can support interested sociologists and/or social scientists who work with R
